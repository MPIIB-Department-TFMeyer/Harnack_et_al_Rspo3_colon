Fig 2 d:
- Microarray data was preprocessed according to Code/Rspo_KO/Preprocess_raw_files.Rmd
- Differential gene expression was calculated according to script Code/Rspo_KO/ExpressionAnalysis.Rmd
- GSEA was run on DGE results using script Code/Rspo_KO/GSEA_Analaysis.Rmd and GSEA plots were generated using Code/Rspo_KO/GSEA_plots.Rmd
- Figures are in Results/ [ Rspo_KO_vs_WT_Lgr5_SC_Signature_Munoz.pdf, Rspo_KO_vs_WT_GO_MITOTIC_RECOMBINATION.pdf ]
